    "In the logistic regression model, we were classifying outcomes as greater or less than 0.5. With the probabilities returned by the Naive Bayes model, a review with a p > 0 is classified as positive, while a review with p < 0 is classified as negative. Just as with the logistic regression model above, the test function for Naive Bayes returns accuracy and F1 score. \n",

    "The value of 0.0 means that when we add the logprior to the log likelihood, we're just adding zero to the log likelihood.  However, the logprior is important because whenever the data is not perfectly balanced, the logprior will be a non-zero value.\n",

To test this hypothesis, I created a negative review that uses positive sounding words, and ran it through both algorithms to see how it was classified. "
